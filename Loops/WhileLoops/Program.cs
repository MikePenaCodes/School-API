/*2. Number Guessing Game (While Loop)
Description: Build a game where the computer generates a random number between 1 and 100, and the player has to guess it. Each time the player guesses incorrectly, the program gives a hint whether the guess is too high or too low.

Requirements:

Use a while loop that runs until the player guesses the correct number.
After each guess, the program should inform the player if the guess is too high or too low.
Keep track of the number of attempts and display it when the player guesses correctly.
Allow the player to quit the game early (ask if they want to keep playing after each guess).
